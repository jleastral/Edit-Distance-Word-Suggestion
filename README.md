Hello, this is a simple word suggest made in java using edit distance algorithm. 
I had a school assignment to find edit distance using dynamic programming to improve a recursive algorithm.
Since I had it, I thought I might as well try one of the applications of edit distance mentioned in the assignment.

## Settup
You will need jdk installed already.
After cloning the repo, compile src files in order.
```
javac -d out src/WordBank.java
javac -d out src/EditDistance.java
javac -d out src/SpellChecker.java
javac -d out src/Repl.java
```

And to run use the command
```
java Repl
```
